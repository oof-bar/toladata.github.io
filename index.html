<p>Evidence and data is used to inform management and decision-making at multiple levels, but primarily focusing on Program managers and staff while simultaneously providing high level reports and dashboard for senior levels within an organization.</p>

<ul>
<li>System meets field team requirements for basic data management and traceability and facilitates quality reporting</li>
<li>System increases efficiency of field teams and reduces wasted money spent on single program solutions</li>
<li>System incorporates the requirements for standard indicators from the Design for Impact Guide (DIG) to enhance program development and design, and improve measurement practice</li>
<li>Enables access to share the results of programs with key stakeholders through various points of analysis (such as country, regional, sectoral, response/initiative, etc)</li>
<li>System integrates with existing tools allowing for ease of use and future maintenance</li>
</ul>
