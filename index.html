<a id="welcome-to-toladata" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-toladata" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to TolaData.</h2>

<p>The goal of Tola is to support adaptive program management and enable experienced-based learning by providing tools that can improve the quality of NGO programs and M&amp;E data.</p>

<p>Tola currently has two primary components that can be adapted for each country context and need:</p>

<h3>
<a id="tola-tables" class="anchor" href="#tola-tables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tola Tables</h3>

<p>Allows users to connect digital data collection tools (such as ODK/Ona, iFormBuilder, etc) as well as Excel or other formats directly to indicators and projects in the system.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tola-activity" class="anchor" href="#tola-activity" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tola Activity</h3>

<p>A set of standard forms, dashboard and approval process that help support adaptive management within an organization.  Also includes a detailed Indicator Tracker, providing teams with a way to track all program indicators and their targets vs. actuals.</p>

<h3>
<a id="benefits" class="anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits</h3>

<p>Evidence and data is used to inform management and decision-making at multiple levels, but primarily focusing on Program managers and staff while simultaneously providing high level reports and dashboard for senior levels within an organization.</p>

<ul>
<li>System meets field team requirements for basic data management and traceability and facilitates quality reporting</li>
<li>System increases efficiency of field teams and reduces wasted money spent on single program solutions</li>
<li>System incorporates the requirements for standard indicators from the Design for Impact Guide (DIG) to enhance program development and design, and improve measurement practice</li>
<li>Enables access to share the results of programs with key stakeholders through various points of analysis (such as country, regional, sectoral, response/initiative, etc)</li>
<li>System integrates with existing tools allowing for ease of use and future maintenance</li>
</ul>
