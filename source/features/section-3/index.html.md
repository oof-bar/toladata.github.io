## Our Approach.

Tolaâ€™s approach utilizes the power of cloud-based technologies to improve program monitoring efforts without losing the ability to work offline in remote areas. Harnessing mobile technology provides a cost-effective alternative to traditional paper and pencil data collection methods, and by conducting surveys using tablets, data collection times are reduced and beneficiary verification is improved. 

Once data has been collected, Tola blends data collection tools with workflow tools and a centralized collection database to allow for cumulative and summary reporting. By using existing open source solutions and standards the Tola team can develop custom implementations, that can integrate with third party software without incurring high maintenance costs.
