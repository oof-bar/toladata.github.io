## Tola. A Pashtun word meaning "Complete".

Tola combines ICT and M&E Systems with Open Data and Open Source tools to provide a dynamic platform for data discovery and high-impact analysis. As part of the Tola service, ICT and M&E advisors will be provided to help a program or country analyze their current portfolio and provide custom solutions based on our well-defined and tested templates and standards. These solutions create a holistic M&E system flexible enough to meet the ever-changing team demands while providing new opportunities to share and roll up data. Tola follows an iterative process in order to improve data pipeline and tools. This is coupled with near real-time monitoring to make informed decisions that ultimately improve programming.
