## Promotes adaptive management.

Each stage of a project is tracked within dashboards allowing managers to see progress at a glance and the ability to drill down to get details or enter more information.  The four primary project forms are supplemented by standard training and beneficiary registration forms with links to individual attendance and beneficiary registration forms.  Project Workflow also includes a larger documentation repository to help track more in-depth or qualitative details of the project as well as a checklist, that can be customized by the user, to track and document the progress of an agreement as it nears the completion stage.
