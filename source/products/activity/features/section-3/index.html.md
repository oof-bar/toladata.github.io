## Evidence-driven Results.

The Indicator Tracking tool is used to create a set of activity, output, outcome and goal indicators for each program, helping donors and staff track the performance of a program or project.  The indicators are defined and agreed upon by the donor(s) before a program is created in the system, then imported via a data service or manually entered.  Progress against each indicator is documented via data entry forms directly through the system or imported through a digital data collection tool or data consolidator like Tola Tables.  These indicators are then linked back to projects tracked through Project Workflow to track targets vs. actuals.
