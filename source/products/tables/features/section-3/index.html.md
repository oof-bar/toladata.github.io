## Open Source, Open Data.

Each table can be shared as a public repository or privately with other users through our external REST data service API for integration with other data platforms or analysis tools or exported to a new or existing Google sheet or downloaded as any number of file types including csv/excel files.  Tola Tables also provides direct record editing and clean up within the tool as well as a set of map and merge tools to allow the user to merge multiple data silos into one.
