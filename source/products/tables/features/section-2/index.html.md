## Mobile Data

Tola Tables directly integrates with mobile data collection providers such as <a href="http://ona.io">Ona</a> to provide users with access to all of their forms and data for import and management in Tola.  Each data set is then manage in its own silo that can then later be mapped and merged into any number of other data silos owned or shared with the user.
